My obsession with visual art began in high school when I
used to spend hours drawing fantastical landscapes and portraits of my friends.
It is attention to detail that makes a drawing come to live. Drawing is a hobby
of mine that doesn’t get a lot of time but I do use the skills from it on a
daily basis. Whether it is at work when putting together a food platter or at
home when I am working on a video game of website. It is the ability to work
with visual art and design that makes simple look gorgeous.
