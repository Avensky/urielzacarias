    <p> I have always been a very passionate person, but only towards things i really enjoyed. This caused me problems in school because I would always memorize the test content then immdediately forget it. After 6 years of not doing much and working dead end jobs, I was finally able to concentrate my passion towards traditional learning. The subjects I enjoy are math, computer, an science. So finally being able to learn on my own is liberating. I am practicing code on my own, learning math on my own, basically chaning my whole life style. I have never been a lazy person, but I can't seem to find a job that fulfils me. I don't like dealing with people, although I love meeting and greeting them. It's not that I dislike people is that it makes me tired.</p>
